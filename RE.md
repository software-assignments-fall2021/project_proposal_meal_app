# Meal App
#### Peiqi Liu(Leo) (pl2285@nyu.edu)
Meal APP is an online suggestion system that provides restaurants an opportunity to exhibit their most delicious meals and provides the customers with information concerned with the most popular restaurants in the city and the best food provided by a given restaurant.

### What and why?
When you planned to eat out in a restaurant, what restaurant should you choose? When you entered the restaurant, what food did you plan to order? What if you entered a restaurant recommended by your friend but found out that the restaurant made only spicy food, which is something you did not like? What if you entered a good restaurant but failed to order the most delicious dishes?

From the restaurants' points of view, how can the restaurant advertise in a cheap and efficient way? How can the restaurant show their best performance to their customers? How can the restaurant know how the customers think of services they provided.

Meal APP provides a good example to serve the need of both customers and restaurants. Anyone in the city, including customers and restaurants can register an account either by email or telephone number. Once registered, restaurant information can be shown in the exhibition, and can receive suggestions and comments from customers. Customers can also check how others comment a restaurant to decide whether going to a restaurant is a good option. Customers can also leave comments after eating in the restaurant.

### For whom?
For people of all ages, genders, religions, and races who wish to eat the most delicious food in the best restaurant in the city and the restaurant who wish to attract their customers with low costs.

### How?
Restaurant: Register the account and start to fill the information, including when the restaurant will be in operation, what food the restaurant provides, where the restaurant locates, and hwo customers can preserve a seat within the restaurant. If time permits, the project can allow the restaurant pay to increase their ranks in the restaurant exhibition page.

Customers: Register the account, fill in their locations and entered the display page. there they can type essential preference (e.g. when the restaurants operate, where the restaurant is, the rate of the restaurant) to search the restaurant they want. Once they find the restaurant, either can they see comments left by the others, ot they can leave their own comments. If time permits, the project can also allow the customers to save the restaurants they like, to save the search they prefer.

### Scope
The project would be an appropriate length for one semester as there are plenty of features which can be created or expanded upon depending on the groupâ€™s discretion. While some features are likely non-negotiable (e.g. the restaurants' operation time, locations, comments received, customers' locations), each group can have a lot of liberty when it comes to what they decide to implement. This app is perfect for a small group for one semester as it will hopefully be an easy to use app while still being functional.
